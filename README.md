## 💡 Notes for Learners

To truly **develop algorithmic thinking**:

- Attempt each problem **without using AI** at first
- Test and **analyze your solution** for correctness and efficiency
- Use AI **only at the end** to compare approaches or optimize your algorithm

This way, you **upgrade your thinking process** while still benefiting from AI as a final guide.
